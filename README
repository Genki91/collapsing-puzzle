This is a simple puzzle game written in Java for the final project of my
first year of university.

To play the game, simply run `java Game` in your respective operating system's
console.

The object of the game is to clear the screen of coloured blocks by clicking
on groups of three or more touching blocks of the same colour. As if that
wasn't exciting enough, there are several game modes and it is possible to
save and load games from human-readable text files.

It was written on a Mac but was demoed on Windows so it should work on both
those platforms at least.

It's not provided here because I think it is a particularly fun game to play
but because--to this day--it is one of the most complicated things I have
ever worked on.
